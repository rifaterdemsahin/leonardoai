Here's an updated version of your `config/scenes.yaml` with two new properties per scene:

1. **script** â€“ a voiceover/dialogue snippet.
2. **outline** â€“ a brief scene description for planning or teleprompting.

```yaml
scenes:
  - id: "01"
    prompt: "Cinematic entrance, wooden front door with engraved details, early morning light, warm glow through doorway, photorealistic, ultraâ€‘detailed"
    text: "Scene 1: Entrance â€“ recall the opening gateway."
    script: "Welcome to our journey. This door marks the beginning of your exploration."
    outline: "Wide shot of the entrance; soft morning sunlight; narrator introduces the path ahead."

  - id: "02"
    prompt: "Cozy living room, plush sofa and fireplace, soft afternoon sunlight, warm tones, digital painting, cinematic composition"
    text: "Scene 2: Living Room â€“ where memories gather."
    script: "Step insideâ€”here, warmth and comfort cradle every thought."
    outline: "Cut to living room; fire crackles; narrator evokes nostalgia."

  # ... repeat for scenes 3 through 19

  - id: "20"
    prompt: "Old wooden garden gate, climbing vines, golden hour backlight, sense of exit or conclusion, cinematic composition, ultraâ€‘detailed"
    text: "Scene 20: Exit â€“ closing the journey."
    script: "Behind this gate lies the end of our journeyâ€”and the start of yours."
    outline: "Close-up on gate close; ambient evening sounds; narrator concludes journey."
```

### ðŸŽ¬ Separate YAML Files for Full Script & Outline

These are standalone versions if you'd rather separate content into dedicated files.

#### `script.yaml`

```yaml
script:
  "01": "Welcome to our journey. This door marks the beginning of your exploration."
  "02": "Step insideâ€”here, warmth and comfort cradle every thought."
  # ...
  "20": "Behind this gate lies the end of our journeyâ€”and the start of yours."
```

#### `outline.yaml`

```yaml
outline:
  "01": "Wide shot of entrance; soft morning sunlight; narrator introduces the path ahead."
  "02": "Cut to living room; fire crackles; narrator evokes nostalgia."
  # ...
  "20": "Close-up on gate close; ambient evening sounds; narrator concludes journey."
```

### âœ… How to Integrate in Python

In your `generate_scene.py`, load both:

```python
with open("config/scenes.yaml") as f:
    scenes = yaml.safe_load(f)["scenes"]
for scene in scenes:
    prompt = scene["prompt"]
    text = scene["text"]
    script = scene["script"]
    outline = scene["outline"]
    # Use or store these values as needed...
```

Or if using separate files:

```python
with open("script.yaml") as f:
    scripts = yaml.safe_load(f)["script"]
with open("outline.yaml") as f:
    outlines = yaml.safe_load(f)["outline"]

script_text = scripts[f"{scene_id:02d}"]
outline_text = outlines[f"{scene_id:02d}"]
```

With these additions, you'll have tightly coordinated visuals, narration, and scene planningâ€”ideal for both production flow and memory palace storytelling. Let me know if you'd like help fleshing out the voiceover or handling YAML loading!
