Here's an enhanced version of your `outline.yaml`, now enriched for YouTube storytelling structure. Each scene entry includes:

* **hook** – the opening draw for viewers.
* **learning\_objectives** – three key takeaways.
* **key\_results** – measurable audience outcomes.

```yaml
outline:
  "01":
    hook: "What if the very first doorway you see could unlock deeper memory paths?"
    learning_objectives:
      - "Recognise the importance of initial mental anchors."
      - "Learn how setting a strong entry point boosts memory."
      - "Understand how to prime the brain with visual cues."
    key_results:
      - "Audience recalls the entrance vividly after video."
      - "Learners apply entrance-anchor technique in a new memory exercise."
      - "Viewers describe at least one anchor detail in comments."
    scene_description: "Wide shot of entrance; soft morning sunlight; narrator introduces the path ahead."
  "02":
    hook: "Ever wondered how the warmth of your living room can evoke a memory cascade?"
    learning_objectives:
      - "Identify how emotional context aids memory encoding."
      - "See the link between familiar spaces and recall speed."
      - "Apply ambient cues to strengthen memory ties."
    key_results:
      - "Audience feels emotional connection to the memory space."
      - "Learners use a personal emotional cue in their own palace."
      - "Comments contain at least one memory triggered by a cozy environment."
    scene_description: "Cut to living room; fire crackles; narrator evokes nostalgia."
  # Repeat similarly for scenes 03 through 19...
  "20":
    hook: "Can one final gate truly seal your journey and cement your memory palace?"
    learning_objectives:
      - "Grasp the concept of closure in mnemonic journeys."
      - "Understand how exit points reinforce memory review."
      - "Learn to design ending anchors for retrieval stability."
    key_results:
      - "Viewers can recite at least 3 palace anchors after finishing."
      - "Learners add an exit anchor to their own palace design."
      - "Audience shares one tip they’ll use in their memory journey."
    scene_description: "Close-up on gate close; ambient evening sounds; narrator concludes journey."
```

### ✅ How to Use

1. **Save as** `config/outline.yaml`.
2. **Load in Python**:

   ```python
   import yaml
   with open("config/outline.yaml") as f:
       outline = yaml.safe_load(f)["outline"]
   scene = outline[f"{scene_id:02d}"]
   hook = scene["hook"]
   objectives = scene["learning_objectives"]
   results = scene["key_results"]
   desc = scene["scene_description"]
   ```
3. **Integrate** hook into intro audio/video overlay (first few seconds).
4. Use **learning objectives** for scripted voiceover after the hook.
5. Use **scene\_description** to guide visuals and narration.
6. Encourage CTAs aligned with **key\_results**, e.g. "Comment below\..."

This setup marries educational structure (learning outcomes + measurable results) with cinematic storytelling and memory palace technique. Let me know if you want the full sequence for all 20 scenes!
