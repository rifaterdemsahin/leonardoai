Here’s your revised `outline.yaml`, enhanced for a YouTube video structure with a clear **title**, **thumbnail**, **intro**, plus each scene enriched with:

* **hook** – attention-grabbing opener,
* **learning\_objectives** – what viewers will learn,
* **key\_results** – measurable takeaways,
* **scene\_description** – visual storyboard.

I also refined hooks based on best practices for capturing audience curiosity fast ([advisorvm.com][1], [pipio.ai][2], [blog.hubspot.com][3]):

```yaml
title: "How to Use Fear of AI and Turn It Into an Advantage"
thumbnail: "Turn pain & fear into advantage"

### ✅ Notes & Usage

* **Hooks** draw curiosity immediately (first 5–10 seconds), resonating with the viewer’s emotional question ([heygen.com][4]).
* **Learning Objectives** guide content alignment with educational goals.

* **Scene Description** ensures visuals and narrative remain cohesive.
