Hereâ€™s your updated YAML structure, simplified to only include the **script ID**, **outline description**, and **loci item** for each sceneâ€”perfect for your Memory Palace method:

```yaml
scenes:
  - scriptid: "01"
    outlineid: "Wide shot of the entrance; soft morning sunlight; narrator introduces the path ahead."
    loci_item: "Giant key turning in the lock, glowing gold"

  - scriptid: "02"
    outlineid: "Cut to living room; fire crackles; narrator evokes nostalgia."
    loci_item: "Oversized glowing book on the sofa armrest"

  - scriptid: "03"
    outlineid: "Pan across kettle and laptop; narrator introduces self-learning path."
    loci_item: "Laptop screen showing AI logo next to kettle steaming"

  # ...continue similarly through scenes 04â€“19...

  - scriptid: "20"
    outlineid: "Close-up on gate close; ambient evening sounds; narrator concludes journey."
    loci_item: "Brass plaque on the gate etched with your name"
```

### ðŸ§  Why This Matters

* **scriptid** links directly to your narrated script segments.
* **outlineid** provides concise visual direction for each scene.
* **loci\_item** functions as the mnemonic anchorâ€”anchored images that engage spatial memory and aid recall ([en.wikipedia.org][1], [en.wikipedia.org][2]).

Every locus should be vivid, tied to the scriptâ€™s emotional or conceptual cue, and easily "walked through" mentally by your viewersâ€”this strengthens memory encoding in line with classical method-of-loci research ([en.wikipedia.org][2]).

Let me know if you'd like help fully populating scenes 04â€“19 or integrating this into your generation pipeline!
