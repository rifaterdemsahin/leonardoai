Here are your updated scene promptsâ€”now precisely aligned with the **script** and fleshed out for **image**, **video**, and **audio** generation using Leonardo.ai and ambient sound tools. Iâ€™ve followed Leonardo.aiâ€™s recommended structure for everything (scene description, style, camera movement, subjects, background, mood, and optional audio cues) ([leonardo.ai][1]).

### ðŸŽ¯ How to Integrate

* **Image prompts**: Supply to `leonardo.post_generations` for still backgrounds in `generate_scene.py`.
* **Video prompts**: Use with Leonardoâ€™s VEO (Motion 2.0) endpoint for animated clipsâ€”just add `"promptEnhance": true` and `"frameInterpolation": true` ([docs.leonardo.ai][2]).
* **Audio prompts**: Feed into any AI ambient audio tool (e.g., TopMediai or Mubert) to generate background ambience ([topmediai.com][3]).

This setup ensures each scene is cohesive across visuals, motion, and sound, tightly matching your scripted narrative. Let me know if you'd like me to generate the full YAML for all 20 scenes or fine-tune any part!
